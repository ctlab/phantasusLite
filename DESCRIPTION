Title: Loading and annotation RNA-Seq counts matrices 
Version: 0.1.0

Description: PhantasusLite – a tool designed to integrate the work with RNA-Seq count matrices into a single and fast R-pipeline. This R-package supports loading the data from GEO by GSE. It provides url access to the remote repository with the archs4, archs4_zoo and dee2 HDF5-files for getting the count matrix. Finally phantasusLite allows to get an ExpressionSet with the expression matrix for future differential expression analysis.
